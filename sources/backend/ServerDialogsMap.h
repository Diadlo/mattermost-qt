/**
 * Some Mattermost actions - for example, deleting a poll are represented by dialog events as follows:
 *
 * 1. The client sends a request to delete a poll (Backend::sendPostAction)
 * 2a. The server replies with "status": "OK", "trigger_id": "XXXX"
 * 2b. The server sends a websocket packet open_dialog with the same "trigger_id": "XXXX"
 * 3. The client sends submit dialog request (Backend::sendSubmitDialog), when both 2a and 2b happen
 *
 * if 2b is received, without 2a, nothing should be performed. This happens when the event is sent from another Mattermost client
